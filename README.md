# DL-F-Mini-Project
EE599: Deep Learning Fundamentals Mini Project


This repo is a mini project for my Deep Learning Fundamentals Course. For my project I will be demonstraiting Universal Approximaiton Theroem through the context of robotics inverse kinematics.


D-H perameters

1) show classical way of solving
2) show issue of 1st attemp with just a rnadomized dataset
3) show solution
4) show rrr simple model
5) show rrrrrr comple model
